## Deliverables

We are going to build an example many-to-many relationship for a code school
with these classes:

* A `Student` class
  * `#initialize` that takes name, grade, age
  * methods to read name and read or write grade and age
  * `#courses` that returns a list of their courses

* A `Course` class
  * `#initialize` that takes title, description
  * readers for title and description

* A `Teacher` class
  <!-- * `#initialize` that takes name, grumpiness, helpfulness -->
  <!-- * accessors name, grumpiness, and helpfulness -->
  <!-- * `.all` method that returns a list of every teacher -->
  * `.grumpiest` method that returns the grumpiest teacher
